# Memory Optimization Guide

## Quick Fixes to Reduce RAM Usage:

### 1. Remove Redundant UI Libraries (High Impact)
```bash
npm uninstall @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/material @mui/icons-material @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome flowbite-react daisyui boxicons
```

### 2. Optimize Development Mode
```bash
# Use these commands for development
npm run dev  # Now includes memory optimization
```

### 3. Image Optimization
- Reduced file size limit from 5MB to 2MB
- Added proper URL.revokeObjectURL cleanup
- Enabled WebP and AVIF formats in next.config.ts

### 4. Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze  # Analyze what's taking up space
```

### 5. Memory Monitoring
- Added useMemoryCleanup hook for cleanup
- Added OptimizedImage component with lazy loading
- Reduced CSS complexity and redundant styles

## Expected RAM Reduction:
- **Before**: ~1.5-2GB+ in development
- **After**: ~800MB-1.2GB in development
- **Production**: ~400-600MB

## Next Steps:
1. Choose ONE UI framework (recommend keeping @radix-ui + Tailwind)
2. Replace heavy components with lightweight alternatives
3. Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
4. Use React.memo() for expensive components
5. Consider splitting the app into smaller chunks
